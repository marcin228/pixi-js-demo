# Introduction
Hello, my name is Marcin and I have prepared two short demos using JS/TS and a PIXI.js library.  
I would appreciate it could take a look at them as well as my [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/marcin228) account that I have been actively working on to demonstrate my dedication and passion for problem-solving.

# About me
I have an experience with creating small 2D games, interactive quizes, product configurators and interactive animations for e-learning platforms with ECMAScript based languages (AS2 -> AS3 -> JS).  
I'm quite familiar with topics like easings, vectors, performance optimizations, trigonometry, z-indexes, collision detection, sockets, physics engine (Box2D). It would be great if we could have a talk.

# Demo #1 (Javascript + PIXI.js)
This is a basic game that is made with vanilla Javascript and PIXI.JS.
Collision detections, controls and physics are all 'hand made'.
There is a playable version provided in the link below.
